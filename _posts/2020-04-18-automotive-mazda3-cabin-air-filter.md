## Procedure

1. Procrastinate until you smell a foul odor coming from the vents. Or be proactive.

1. On the passenger side, pop off the small panel next to the floor mat with your mouth. Alternatively, use your hands.

1. Pop off the panel underneath the glove box via the big-ass tabs seen on the left and right.

1. The blower motor resistor housing is now fully exposed. The cabin air filter and a legion of dismembered bugs lurk within. Grab a Phillips screwdriver and unscrew the two screws shown below. If you're tall with a big head, this will require some yoga.

1. Once the blower motor resistor is removed, you have direct access to the filter itself. The cabin air filter comes in two stacked halves. Observe how they're stacked when removing them. When inserting the new filter, the half with the foam goes in first. The foam should be on top, and the thicker tab should face out. Once in, push that first half upward so you can slide the second half through the same opening. Again, the thicker tab should face out. Make sure it all fits well together. Now, enjoy a photo of my dirty filter.

1. Put everything back - especially the blower motor resistor (the card-looking thing). The cabin air cools the resistor.
